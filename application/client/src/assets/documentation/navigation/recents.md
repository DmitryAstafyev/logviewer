# Recent actions

Chipmunk tracks not only recently opened files but also recently created streams. 

The main list of recent actions is present on Chipmunk's home screen. But it is also available with `Ctrl + P` (`Command + P`). In this case, a recent actions list is mixed with file(s) from favorite places.
