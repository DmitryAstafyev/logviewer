# Checked / uncheked / disabled filters

- *Cheked* filer will be used to make a search and matches will be shown in a search results view.
- *Unchecked* filters will no be used to make a search, but colors still are applying and rows with matches will be highlighted in main view.
- *Disabled* filter will not be considered in search and will not be highlighted. Disabling of filters are useful to turn off some filter complitely, but still have a way to quickly restore it
