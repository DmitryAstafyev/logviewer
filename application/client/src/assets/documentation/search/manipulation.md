# Checked/Unchecked/Disabled filters

- *Cheked* filer will be used to make a search and matches will be shown in a search results view.
- *Unchecked* filters will not be used to make a search, but colors still be applied and rows with matches will be highlighted in the main view.
- *Disabled* filter will not be considered in the search and will not be highlighted. Disabling filters are useful to turn off some filter completely but still have a way to quickly restore it
