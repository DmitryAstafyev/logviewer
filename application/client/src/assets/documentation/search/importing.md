# Import/export filters

Filters/charts will be associated with an opened file (or stream). Next time the same file (or stream) is opened, filters/charts will be restored.

At the same time, there are a couple of ways to export/import filters:

- via the context menu on the list of filters/charts
- via tab "History/Profiles" to export/import different collections of filters/charts
