Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chipmunk! This document provides a guide to setting up your development environment and making contributions. Chipmunk is developed using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the backend processing and [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/) for the frontend application.

## Prerequisites

To build and run Chipmunk locally, ensure you have the following languages installed on your system:

1. Rust
2. NodeJS

To conveniently check if all prerequisites are met, you can run the provided shell script from the root of the repository in your terminal:

```sh
sh developing/scripts/check.sh
```

If the script indicates success (e.g., prints success messages), you have all necessary prerequisites and can proceed to [installing dependencies](/chipmunk/contributing/preparing). 
If the script reports that prerequisites are missing, please install them before continuing with the setup.
